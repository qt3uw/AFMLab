The resolution of this image is not important because this image is only for locating features. Once you see the feature you would like to look at closer, stop the scan and use the Zoom feature to take a closer scan of the desired feature with 250px resolution. If you need to restart the zoom scan, you have to reselect the zoom window because the start coordinates of the scan are not saved.",
